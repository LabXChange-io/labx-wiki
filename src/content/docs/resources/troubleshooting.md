<b>User Support Guidelines</b>
<br /><br />
<b>1. Staff Users</b>

Staff users encountering issues such as missing data, access problems, or unexpected behavior should first reach out to their designated client administrator(s) for resolution.

Client administrators have elevated permissions that allow them to manage user access, data, and certain configurations. In most cases, client admins will be able to resolve these issues without external support.
<br /><br /><br />
<b>2. Client Administrators</b>

If a client administrator encounters an issue that their additional access does not allow them to resolve, they should escalate the matter to LabXchange Support.

_Support Contact: support@labxchange.io_

When reaching out for support, client admins should include the following details for faster resolution:

- A clear description of the issue

- Any error messages received

- Steps taken to troubleshoot

- Affected users (if applicable)

- Screenshots (if relevant) 
<br /><br /><br />
<b>Common Troubleshooting Steps:</b>

Before reaching out for support, users should try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Refresh the page and try again.

- Clear browser cache and cookies.

- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

- Log out and log back in.

- Ensure correct role assignments by checking user permissions.

- Check for any active system-wide issues by verifying with other users.

- If these steps do not resolve the issue, follow the escalation path outlined above.
<br /><br /><br />
<b>Important Notes:</b>

Staff users should not contact LabXchange support directly; all issues must go through client administrators first.

Client admins have additional access to manage users and troubleshoot data issues independently.

LabXchange Support is only for client admins who encounter issues beyond their available permissions.

For further questions, client admins should reach out to support@labxchange.io.
