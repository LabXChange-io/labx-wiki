#### This is where orders for Rapid Tests get placed.

##### The 'Rapid Tests' are essentially the same as orders in most respects, and as such, the documentation available for Order already, such as [Search](/orders/search), [Details](/orders/details) and [Add/Edit](/orders/add_edit), can be used almost entirely for these as well.

##### The primary difference with a rapid test is that it will be a type of test that gives results immediately after it's taken, such as a COVID test, and doesn't need to be sent to a lab for processing. This means an additional action will be available immediately after the order is created and is in "Pending" status - "Add Result" with which the results of the test can immediately be added to the system:

- **A.** The specific info for the order to confirm who the results are for.
- **B.** Set the type of data being put in.
- **C.** Provide the value of the result.
- **D.** If needed, activate and provide a result status indication.
- **E.** If needed, activate and include any additional notes.
- **F.** Click "Add Results" to save changes and add this new result.

##### These rapid tests are most commonly associated with planned events that have had [Schedules](/admin/schedules) set up and are being managed with [Appointments](/appointments/).
