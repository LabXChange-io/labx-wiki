- **A.** This is the indicator for whether or not the application can see and connect to the default Zebra printer through the local Zebra Browser Print service.

- **C.** This is the quantity selector for printing a few copies of the same label.

##### Note: This only supports printing to the default Zebra device.  There is no selector for all available Zebras because Zebra's browser print service does not support this.  The list of multiple devices Zebra offers is for networked Zebra devices only, so using it would block all Zebra devices connected via USB from being reachable.
