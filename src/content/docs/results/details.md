#### The Results Details page is where you can search review all of the details returned for a given result or results.

- **A.** This panel, if expanded, provides some specific patient information.
    - If the patient hasn't been matched, there will be less data showing and a Match Patient button to manually make the connection with.
- **B.** Once a patient is matched, there is a Quick View short cut button to pull up the [Patient Details page](/patients/details/) for this patient.
- **C.** This panel, if expanded, provides some specific order infomration. 
- **D.** This result has not been matched yet, so we have a Match Order button showing. (see first below)
    - Note: The patient has to be matched first, in a very similar dialog, before the order matching can be used.
- **E.** A result not matched to an order is considered 'Unsolicited' and will be flagged as such.
- **F.** The test results for all tests in the order are below the patient and order panels.
- **G.** Any specific notes for the tests will also be available with the results.
- **H.** When viewing more than one result, ythe header will contain a counter, indicating the total and which is displayed.
    - If only one is being viewed, the header will simply display "Result Details".
- **I.** When viewing multiple, these controls appear at the bottom to toggle between results.
- **J.** View a downloadble PDF sheet of the result.
- **K.** Toggle the Reviewed Status of this result.
- **L.** View the available history of this result. (see second below)

- **A.** The left panel shows the current result data, including the matched patient and tests resulted.
- **B.** The right panel is for finding an existing order in the system to match up to the result.
    - Most of the fields are static - (patient, order number, tests), to show the information for the order chosen to match.
- **C.** This selection is to chose which order for the patient specified matches to this result.
- **D.** This button cancels out of the matching without making any changes.
- **E.** This button accepts the chosen order as matching this result and updates the records to reflect this.
- **F.** If no matching orders can be located, then this button is a quick shortcut to the [Create Orders Page](/orders/add_edit/) to go add a matching order.

- **A.** This history log shows specific details about who placed the order and when.
- **B.** It also logs the user interactions with the results.
- **C.** The display defaults to only a few actions with a "View More" button, in this case it's expanded already, so we see the "View Less" button to collapse it back down.
