### This is the screen visible only to Providers when they sign in to review their queue of orders for signing. 
##### This page is really just the [Orders Search Page](/orders/search/) filtered down to just those records the signed in Provider needs to sign or review, with a few minor differences:

![SignOrders](/screenPrints/SignOrder1.png)

- **A.** There is an Approval Status column showing the provider which orders they approved and which are still pending approval.
- **B.** "For Approval" records are waiting for the provider to approve them.
- **C.** "Authorized" records have been approved by the provider - either here on this page (see below) or at the time of order by attached a signed order document.
- **D.** This ... allows the provider to view any orders in their queue or to chose 'Sign Order' on those waiting for approval.
- **E.** Use these check boxes to select multiple orders at the same time for a quicker approval process.
- **F.** After selecting multiple, use this ... in the header to quickly approve all at once with a single click.
- **G.** Filter the orders down by status.
- **H.** Search for specific orders by Id or Patient.
- **I.** Filter the orders down to those from a specific location group.
- **J.** Create and download or print a manifest list of mulitple orders.

![SignOrders](/screenPrints/SignOrder2.png)

- **A.** Cancel exits out of this dialog without approving.
- **B.** Confirm signs off on the order and closes the dialog.
- **C.** This is the dialog for a provider with a digital signature already on file. 
    - If a provider has never signed before, they will get a different prompt which permits them to create and save a digital signature, which is then used going forward.
